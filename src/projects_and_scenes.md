# Projects and Scenes

## Conventions

- 1 blender unit = 1 meter
- +Z is up, +Y is forward
- Objects and characters should rest on the ground plane (Z=0)
- Objects and characters with bilateral symmetry should be centered on and mirrored over the Y plane

## Creating a new file

You can save a starting file from File > Defaults menu.

To get a nice basic setup for 3D prop modelling for gamedev:

1. Delete starting camera and light.
   1. These aren't useful when creating props or characters for game dev.
2. Move the default cube up so its base is on the ground plane.
