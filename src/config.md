# Configuring Blender

There are a few things I like to change from the stock Blender install.

## Navigation

- orbit around selection
  - easier to navigate fluidly
- zoom to mouse position
  - more intuitive, and you no longer run into the "cannot zoom any further" problem

## Keymap

- Spacebar action -> Search
  - more generally useful than animation playing
