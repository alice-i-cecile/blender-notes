# Configuring Blender

There are a few things I like to change from the stock Blender install.

## Navigation

- orbit around selection
  - easier to navigate fluidly
- zoom to mouse position
  - more intuitive, and you no longer run into the "cannot zoom any further" problem

## Keymap

- Spacebar action -> Search
  - more generally useful than animation playing
  
## Panels

- Collapse animation panel at the bottom
  - Animation is cool, but irrelevant when modelling
  - Can also change to a different panel using the gear icon in the top left

## Extensions and Addons

- Bool Tool extension
  - Great for building interesting base geometry
